# IT89092_SimpleBookBorrowing


You are tasked with creating a program that allows a user to borrow books from a library. 
The program should have a class for a person, which has a name, age, and an array to keep 
track of borrowed books. 

There should also be a class for a book, which has book id, title, author, ISBN number, and a 
Boolean flag to indicate whether it is borrowed or not. The program should initialize with an 
array of book objects. 

When the program is run, the user should be prompted to select a book to borrow from a list of 
available books. If the user selects an invalid option, they should be prompted to try again. 

After the user borrows a book, they should be asked if they want to borrow another book. If 
they do, the list of available books should be displayed again. 

This process should continue until the user decides not to borrow any more books. Finally, 
the program should display a list of all the books the user has borrowed.
